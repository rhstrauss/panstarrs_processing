   Comments and blank lines may be added freely.  (Anything beginning
   with a space is a comment.)  If a line is uncommented,  it's probably
   controlled via the user interface.

   The default version of this file is stored in 'environ.def'.  Once
   you've run Find_Orb or 'fo' (Find_Orb's non-interactive sibling),  new
   settings are written to 'environ.dat'.  If you decide at some point that
   you'd like to reset to factory defaults,  just delete 'environ.dat'.

   The following line gives the default MPC code for ephems;  a zero for
   a now-obsolete quantity;  and (for interactive Find_Orb) quantities
   specifying how residuals are displayed and whether all,  some,  or
   only one MPC code(s) are displayed at the bottom of the screen.
CONSOLE_OPTS=500 0 3 1

   The 'settings' give the comet magnitude type used (defaults to 'N', or
   'nuclear');  the format used for orbital elements;  the precision used
   in orbital elements (defaults to five places for angular elements);  a
   zero,  for a no-longer-used quantity;  the maximum residual filtered,
   in arcseconds (defaults to 2);  and the Gaussian "noise" added,  in
   sigmas,  when running Monte Carlo orbits.
SETTINGS=N,4,5,0,2.000000,1.000000

   Ephemeris options are enumerated at
   https://www.projectpluto.com/fo_usage.htm#eph_opts . This line just
   specifies which options are currently set for ephemerides.  Defaults are
   10 (round time to nearest ephemeris step) and 16 (show uncertainties).
EPHEM_OPTIONS=10,16

DEFAULTS=N4
EPHEM_START=+0

   By default,  ephems start 'now' (above line),  and run for twenty
   one-hour steps (next two lines.)

EPHEM_STEPS=10
EPHEM_STEP_SIZE=1
REFERENCE=Find_Orb

   'filtering' gives the assumed probability that an observation is a blunder
   (defaults to 2%);  the over-observing time span (defaults to one day);  the
   "ceiling" on over-observing (defaults to five observations);  and a number
   which is 1 if "filtering" uses blunder management,  or 0 if we are doing
   traditional rejection based on an observation having residuals greater
   than N sigmas,  with N specified in 'settings' (see above).  By default,
   blunder management is used (see the Find_Orb Web page for a description of
   blunder management and over-observing parameters).
FILTERING=2.000 1.000000 5 1

   Observations sent via e-mail frequently end up with spaces added
   or removed.  Find_Orb will (usually) parse such observations anyway.
   Remove or comment out the following line,  and Find_Orb will switch
   to being "strict" about lines being exactly 80 characters long,  etc.
FIX_OBSERVATIONS=1

   By default,  ephemerides can cover the range -1000 to +3000.  If you want
   to go beyond that,  alter the following line.
TIME_RANGE=-1000,3000

   Observations,  on the other hand,  normally don't go nearly that far
   back or into the future.
OBSERVATION_DATE_RANGE=1100,2300

   Some observers have requested that their observations not be
   re-distributed.  (Sometimes embargoed until a paper is written,  for
   example.)  For specific observations,  one can put an exclamation mark
   (!) in column 73 of the 80-column record. ATLAS would prefer that their
   observations of artsats (but not of heliocentric objects) not be
   re-distributed,  so their obscodes are followed by an asterisk.
   Obscodes without an asterisk would just be redacted in their entirety.
REDACTED=M22* T05* T08* W22*

   We default to assuming that no object will have an observed arc greater
   than 200 years,  and that if it _is_ longer than that,  it's a mistake.
   This is a pretty good assumption,  though some comets and four asteroids
   do have longer observed arcs than this,  possibly requiring you to
   adjust the following line.
MAX_OBSERVATION_SPAN=200

   For radar stations,  power (in watts), temp in K, gain, altitude limit
   in degrees,  and an arbitrary "radar constant" are needed.  So far,  the
   only radar stations for which I have those data are (251) Arecibo and
   (253) Goldstone.  [Correction:  at least most of these data are provided
   in Table 1 of https://arxiv.org/pdf/1604.01080v1.pdf.  And Table 2 provides
   'relative sensitivities',  based on DSS-14 Goldstone (253) = 1, including
   for bistatic modes.  One could,  and I probably eventually will,  copy the
   (253) line for use with other stations;  compute ephemerides that way;
   replace the power,  temperature,  etc. values with the ones that actually
   apply for that telescope;  then scale up/down the "radar constant" to get
   SNRs that are the appropriate multiple of (253) Goldstone.]
      2020 May 22: corrected Arecibo parameters based on
   http://www.naic.edu/~pradar/detect.php . As that page explains,  Hurricane
   Maria downgraded the power level to 350 kW (was 900) and the gain to 7
   (was 10).  Sadly,  it didn't get upgraded.
RADAR_251=350000,24,7,70.5,1.5e-11
RADAR_253=430000,17,.94,20,1e-11
   The Parkes radio telescope in Australia lacks an official MPC code.  But it
   has an unofficial MPC code in 'rovers.txt' (q.v.).
RADAR_d43=430000,17,.94,20,7e-14

   The Allen Telescope Array is a radio telescope,  not radar.  I am inserting
   bogus values here so that "visible" will mean "the object is above the
   horizon",  rather than "the object is above the horizon and it's night".
RADAR_ATA=0,17,.94,10,0

   'Settings2' gives five parameters.  The first is 1 if observation weighting
   is used and 0 if it is not.  Next,  the 'faint limit' on ephemerides (by
   default,  ephemerides are not listed if the object is fainter than mag 22).
   The third value defaults to zero;  if it's non-zero,  the positional sigmas
   for observations are shown in the (normally blank) columns 57-65 of MPC
   reports.  The fourth number indicates a central object for orbital
   elements.  The default -2 means "pick a central object automatically".
      The final number is 1 if FCCT14 or EFCC18 astrometric debiasing is
   applied,  and 0 if it is not.  These methods remove (much of) the systematic
   catalog position/proper motion biases from older catalogs,  and their use
   is highly recommended.  See https://www.projectpluto.com/bias.htm for more
   information.
SETTINGS2=1 22.00 0 -2 0

   Note the comments in the above paragraph about FCCT14/EFCC18 debiasing.
   By default,  Find_Orb looks for the 'bias.dat' file to be in the same
   directory as Find_Orb itself.  However,  you can set the file name
   (either the FCCT14 or EFCC18 one) with the following line.
FCCT14_FILE=

   Most JPL filenames can be automatically detected via the list in
   'jpl_eph.txt'.  But if it's in a different folder or an odd name,  you
   can add the path to one of the following,  depending on whether you're
   on Windows or Linux.  (LINUX_JPL_FILENAME is also used for OS/X and *BSD.)
LINUX_JPL_FILENAME=
JPL_FILENAME=

   When Find_Orb loads up a short arc,  it uses "statistical ranging"
   (SR),  and defaults to trying 100 possible orbits at a mix of
   distances and radial velocities to characterize the possible orbits
   for the object.  You can raise or lower that number here.
MAX_SR_ORBITS=100

   By default,  if asteroid perturbers are turned on,  Pallas is included
   if it is within 10 AU of our target object.  This 'asteroid threshhold'
   is scaled by the square root of the perturbing asteroid's mass;  for
   example,  an asteroid with a quarter the mass of Pallas would only
   be included if it were within 5 AU.  This helps to assure that the tiny
   contributions of most of the 300 asteroids do not have to be computed.
   If you think you have a case where they _do_ matter,  increase the
   following setting.  If you think you're unnecessarily including asteroid
   perturbations that cannot possibly matter,  decrease it.
ASTEROID_THRESH=10

   By default,  we consider all 300 asteroids listed in BC-405.  You can
   get a good speed-up by cutting this down,  at the risk of maybe ignoring
   some tiny rock that just happens to pull your target around more than
   you expected.  (See the next option,  too.)
BC405_ASTEROIDS=300

   By default,  Find_Orb uses a bit of logic to determine which asteroids
   are close enough to have detectable perturbations.  (If it just added
   in perturbations from all 300 all the time,  it would slow to a crawl.)
   You can set the ASTEROID_PERT_LIST line to list a set of asteroids to
   be used at all times,  to the exclusion of others.  This can help in
   replicating the results of other programs;  if an integrator always
   uses Ceres,  Pallas,  and Vesta (a common choice),  you would set
   ASTEROID_PERT_LIST=1,2,4.  To replicate JPL's "Big-16" scheme,  you
   would use ASTEROID_PERT_LIST=1,2,3,4,6,7,10,15,16,29,52,65,87,88,511,704
   for DE-43x.  As of DE-44x,  Horizons has swapped some perturbers :
   ASTEROID_PERT_LIST=1,2,3,4,10,15,16,31,48,52,65,87,88,451,511,704
   (the order doesn't matter.)  See
   ftp://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/xfr/gm_Horizons.pck.
ASTEROID_PERT_LIST=

   By default,  geocentric elements are referred to the J2000 _equator_.
   Everything else (heliocentric and other non-earth-centric) is referred
   to the J2000 _ecliptic_.  Set the following to be 1 to force all
   elements to be J2000 ecliptic (including geocentric ones),  or 2 to
   force all elements to be J2000 equatorial.  Set it to be 3 to force
   all elements to be body-centric.  Note that for geocentric elements,
   this will result in elements that are slightly different from those you'd
   get by default,  due to precession and nutation since 2000;  the angles
   should be passably close to those seen in TLEs.
ELEMENTS_FRAME=0

   Find_Orb will apply geopotential terms (spherical harmonics) for objects
   close to the earth.  It has a bit of logic to determine how many should
   be computed,  as a function of distance (only J2 for most cases,  but
   many terms as one gets close to the earth).  The following GEO_TERMS
   quantity can be raised to include more terms,  or lowered to get better
   speed for artsats.  However,  through experimentation,  I've found that
   setting it to the default value of 6 gets good results;  increasing it
   doesn't change orbits much,  lowering it causes them to start showing
   errors.
GEO_TERMS=6

   Find_Orb can use either the method of Encke (do a two-body solution relative
   to the 'best fitting' body,  integrating perturbations to that orbit).  By
   default,  it instead uses the method of Cowell (the 'direct' method,  in
   which you just integrate the accelerations from all bodies).  I'm still
   experimenting with both methods.  But you will probably be best off leaving
   this value at zero,  meaning Cowell is used.
ENCKE=1

   By default,  the DRAG_SHUTOFF=1 tells Find_Orb not to include the effects
   of atmospheric drag.  Set it to zero if you want objects entering the
   earth's atmosphere to be affected by drag.
DRAG_SHUTOFF=1

   By default,  Find_Orb will look for an orbit covering,  at most,  20
   years (7300 days) of observations.  This is simply for speed reasons,
   and you can toggle additional observations once the object is loaded
   and extend the orbit.   You can adjust the initial parameter here.
AUTO_ARC_LEN=7300

   VECTOR_OPTS gives three values controlling state vector and Cartesian
   coordinate ephemerides.  The first value can be zero (the default) for
   equatorial vectors,  or one for ecliptic.  (I may add body plane
   coordinates eventually.)  The second value is a multiplier for length.
   Lengths default to being in AU,  with this multiplier being 1.
   Set it to 149597870.7 (the number of kilometers in one AU) to switch
   to kilometers,  or to 23454.7800299146773197201 to switch the distance
   unit to Earth radii (this assumes the equatorial radius of 6378.140 km.)
   The final value gives the time unit:  1=days (default),  24=hours,
   1440=minutes, 86400=seconds.  For example,  VECTOR_OPTS=1,149597870.7,86400
   would get you ecliptic J2000 vectors in kilometers and km/s.
      By default,  the vectors will be in the J2000 epoch.  You can add
   (for example) ',2016' to get output in the J2016 epoch,  or ',t' for
   output in true coordinates of date,  or ',m' for mean coordinates of
   date.  So,  for example,  VECTOR_OPTS=0,1,1,1975 would result in
   equatorial J1975 vectors in AU and days.
VECTOR_OPTS=0,1,1

   Comet non-gravitational forces in the "standard" Marsden-Sekanina model
   are assumed to be due to sublimating ice.  As described at page 3 of

   http://www.lpi.usra.edu/books/CometsII/7009.pdf

   'Cometary Orbit Determination and Nongravitational Forces',  D. K. Yeomans,
   P. W. Chodas, G. Sitarski, S. Szutowicz, M. Krolikowska, "Comets II",
   this leads to a force whose magnitude is given by a function g(r),  with
   parameters r0, m, n,  and k.  The following line gives those constants for
   non-gravs driven by sublimating water ice.  Sekanina and Kracht have
   proposed different r0, m, n, and k for other sublimation processes.  If
   you want to do that,  change the line below.  (Note that 'alpha' isn't
   given;  it's a normalization quantity to ensure g(1) = 1.  Find_Orb
   will compute it for you.)

COMET_CONSTANTS=2.808,2.15,5.093,4.6142

   Initial orbit determination (IOD) usually takes a couple of seconds.
   For longer arcs,  it might take five or ten seconds.  If it takes more
   than IOD_TIMEOUT seconds (defaults to 20),  we stop looking for a better
   initial orbit and take whatever our best orbit thus far is.  (Such cases
   usually come about because the observations are inconsistent and there
   isn't really a meaningful orbit that fits them.)
IOD_TIMEOUT=20

   Find_Orb defaults to looking for the BC405 ephemeris file (orbital elements
   at 40-day intervals for 300 asteroids used in the BC405 theory;  see
   https://www.projectpluto.com/ast_pert.htm for details) in its configuration
   directory,  then the local directory.  But using the following line,  you
   can move the 'asteroid_ephemeris.txt' file to a different directory,  and/or
   rename it.
# BC405_FILENAME=/home/phred/big/asteroid_ephemeris.txt

   I had a request (https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/find_orb/conversations/messages/35)
   for an option to output planetary state vectors at the epoch of the orbital
   elements to 'elements.txt'.  If you want to do that,  set PLANET_STATES=1.
   By default,  it's blank and planet states are not written out.
PLANET_STATES=

   When looking for precoveries,  one may want to list only images that
   haven't been measured yet,  or only those that have been measured.  (Note
   that the only way Find_Orb knows which images have been measured is by
   looking at the astrometry.  That is to say,  if the astrometry you've used
   to compute the orbit came from an image,  Find_Orb will notice that fact.
   Otherwise,  it'll assume that the image in question hasn't been measured.)
   A value of 1 means "show only measured images";  2="show only unmeasured";
   0 or blank means "show all images".
FIELD_INCLUSION=0

   Set the following COMBINE_ALL parameter to any non-blank value,  and all
   observations in a file will be loaded as if they were of a single object.
   This can be convenient when you're checking a linkage,  for example;  you
   can compute an orbit based on all the observations without having to
   change the designations to all be the same.
COMBINE_ALL=

   In computing impact points on the earth,  we're really mostly interested
   in the point where the object 'collides' with the upper atmosphere and
   is slowed down/explodes.  Rob Matson tells me that for a 2-3 meter object,
   it should become visible at about 90 km and drop below 3 km/s by the time
   it gets down to 20-25 km.  That's a bit of a range;  let's go with 50 km.
   (The collision altitude is actually specified in meters,  though.)  Note
   that the 'collision altitude' for anything except the earth is zero;  that
   probably should be modified for objects with atmospheres.
COLLISION_ALTITUDE=50000

   Current available language settings are e (English), f (French), i
   (Italian), d (German), r (Russian), s (Spanish).  More could be added,
   and the current not-very-complete translations improved;  please let
   me know if you're interested.
LANGUAGE=e

   By default,  ephems show RAs to 0.001 seconds and decs to 0.01 arcseconds.
   The following values cause ephemerides to show RAs to three places in
   seconds,  decs to two places in arcseconds.  Format numbers 101 to 116
   will get you get decimal hours (in RA) or degrees (in dec) with one to
   sixteen places.  Format numbers -1 to -9 will get you hours/minutes (for
   RA) or degrees/arcmin (for dec) with zero to eight places after the
   decimal.  Format numbers 200 to 215 are for RA only,  to get decimal
   degrees.  Note that the higher-precision values will be almost
   meaningless noise.
      A full list of formats is provided at
   https://github.com/Bill-Gray/lunar/blob/mpc_fmt.cpp
   (search for comments above the get_ra_dec() function.)
RA_DEC_FORMAT=3,2

   By default,  Find_Orb does a decent job of figuring out which objects
   should be included as perturbers.  But if you want to insist that all
   computations include certain objects,  you can use the line below to
   do so.  It's a hexadecimal number that is the sum of 2=Mercury,  4=Venus,
   8=Earth, ... 100 = Neptune, 200=Pluto, 400=the Moon.  The sun is always
   included.  So 7fe,  for example,  would be (nine) planets plus the moon.
   408 would add just the earth and moon.  Note that if Find_Orb detects
   that an orbit would pass close to,  say,  Neptune,  then it will be
   turned on automatically.
PERTURBERS=0

   In console Find_Orb,  one can have every (say) fifth observation
   underlined by setting the following value to 5.  This can make the
   observation section a little easier to read.  Not everybody agrees
   with me on this,  though,  so the default is for it to be unset.
UNDERLINE_OBS=

   By default,  JSON files 'elements.json',  'elem_short.json',
   'ephemeri.json',  and 'combined.json' will be made in the configuration
   directory (same directory as this file.)  But that default behavior can
   be overridden with the following lines.  See
   https://www.projectpluto.com/fo_usage.htm#json_files for details on how
   these work.  Note that different lines are used for Windows(R) than for
   Linux,  OS/X,  and *BSD.
JSON_EPHEM_NAME=~/UW/PanSTARRS/json/eph%p.json
JSON_ELEMENTS_NAME=~/UW/PanSTARRS/json/ele%p.json
JSON_SHORT_ELEMENTS=~/UW/PanSTARRS/json/short%p.json
JSON_COMBINED_NAME=~/UW/PanSTARRS/json/com%p.json

WIN_JSON_COMBINED_NAME=

   By default,  ecliptic elements are shown in the J2000 frame.  You
   can set,  for example,  'ELEMENT_EPOCH=B1950 ecliptic' or
   'ELEMENT_EPOCH=B1767.0 ecliptic' to get those frames.  Set
   'ELEMENT_EPOCH=ecliptic of date' date to get elements in the epoch
   of date.
ELEMENT_EPOCH=J2000 ecliptic

   Find_Orb can use an Earth Orientation Parameters (EOP) file such
   ftp://ftp.iers.org/products/eop/rapid/standard/finals.all , with
   the filename specified with the EOP_FILE parameter.  Correcting for
   small variations in the earth's orientation (spin and spin axis)
   can lead to differences at the millisecond level for close-in
   objects.  By default,  Find_Orb will look for 'finals.all'.
EOP_FILE=finals.all

   By default,  magnitudes in ephemerides are shown to tenths.  Set
   the following to MAG_DIGITS=2 to get hundredths (almost always
   a meaningless level of precision,  but some people do get good
   photometry...)
MAG_DIGITS=1

   By default,  sigmas and covariance matrix values in 'covar.txt'
   are shown to an abbreviated precision.  It normally makes no sense
   to say that you have determined,  for example,  the semimajor axis
   to +/- 0.3141592653 AU;  0.31 AU would suffice,  and many would
   argue for 0.3.  In some cases,  though,  you may want/need more
   digits.  Increment FULL_SIGMAS,  and you get an extra digit of
   precision in both sigmas and in (most) 'covar.txt' values.  The
   value set for FULL_SIGMAS must be at least 2 and no greater than 10.
FULL_SIGMAS=3

   In computing SNRs in ephemerides,  Find_Orb defaults to assuming
   30-second exposures.  That can be modified below.
EXPTIME=30

   In computing exposure durations in ephemerides,  Find_Orb defaults
   to assuming a target SNR=4.  That can be modified below.
SNR=4

   Diameters for asteroids are estimated based on an assumed albedo
   of 10%.  Your assumed (or measured) albedo may be different,  in
   which case you should modify the following.
OPTICAL_ALBEDO=0.10

   One normally thinks of "astrometric RA/dec" as meaning "a position
   corresponding to a precise star catalog,  such as Gaia."  The
   determination of astrometric RA/dec as described in the USNO
   _Astronomical Almanac_,  and as used in JPL's Horizons system,
   corresponds to this with one minor detail: the difference between
   the gravitational deflection of light from the object and the
   deflection of starlight is neglected.  You still have to consider it
   in processing observations -- the physics of how the light is
   deflected is unchanged by human conventions -- but if you want to get
   RA/decs in ephemerides to match Horizons to below the milliarcsecond
   level,  set the following quantity to 1.  Leave it blank (the default),
   and ephemeris RA/decs will match star catalogs.
DISABLE_LIGHT_BENDING=

   Normally,  site information comes from 'scope.json' (q.v.).  Some may
   wish to override that choice by specifying a full file name here.
SCOPE_JSON_FILE=

   The following observers are actually radiotelescope receivers (for
   artsat tracking).  Unlike optical observers,  they can work in the
   daytime;  observations made in daylight won't get warnings,  and
   ephemerides won't be suppressed when the sky gets bright.  Unlike
   Goldstone or Arecibo,  they don't transmit.
DAYTIME_OBS_OK1=ScT ATA 256 EKa

   By default,  ephemeris uncertainties are shown as one-sigma differences
   from the nominal.  Some sources show three-sigma differences (for which
   you would set SIGMA_MULTIPLIER,  below,  to 3) or three-sigma "full
   width" uncertainties,  i.e.,  "you'd have to scan the following length
   to get from -3 to +3 sigmas".  For that,  you'd set SIGMA_MULTIPLIER=6.
SIGMA_MULTIPLIER=1

   For some purposes,  it can help to add the light contribution from the
   galactic background when computing sky brightness.  (See
   https://www.projectpluto.com/gal_conf.htm for a discussion of how Find_Orb
   computes galactic confusion from Gaia-DR2.)  We're still trying to figure
   out just how much it matters and in what way;  it's not "smeared out" the
   way moonlight,  twilight,  sky glow,  and zodiacal light are.  If the
   following value is non-zero,  then at maximum galactic background levels,
   that many magnitudes per arcsecond are added to the V band background,
   and exposure durations will be correspondingly longer.  GALACTIC_ADDENDUM=18
   seems to work fairly well,  but again,  tweaking will be required.
GALACTIC_ADDENDUM=

   Rarely,  you will encounter astrometry with no photometry.  By default,
   that results in no H (absolute mag) parameter being computed or shown.
   Set,  for example,  DEFAULT_V_MAG=21,  and in such cases,  Find_Orb will
   assume the object was observed at Vmag = 21 and compute H accordingly.
   This is a convenience for some automated uses where you really want
   _some_ H given to indicate,  at the very least,  "it's really big" vs.
   "it's really small".  Obviously,  if possible,  supply photometry.
DEFAULT_V_MAG=

   The 'elements.txt' file created by Find_Orb has some 'comment' data not
   shown by default.  You can toggle to it by clicking on the orbital elements
   shown on-screen,  and some people just look at the 'elements.txt' file
   directly.  By default,  a _lot_ of comments are shown.  However,  you can
   change the following line to (for example) COMMENT_SHUTOFF=State Tis to
   shut off the state vector and Tisserand output.  Setting it to
   COMMENT_SHUTOFF=TLE State MOID Twrit ObsRange Ver Per DE Tis Vinf Sco Pse
   will shut off TLEs (shown only for geocentric objects),  state vectors,
   MOIDs for eight planets,  the time the elements were written,  data about
   the time span/number of observations,  Find_Orb version info,  perturber
   data,  JPL DE version info,  Tisserand data,  Vinf relative to Earth,
   "score" (a quantity describing Find_Orb's confidence in the orbit,  based
   on residuals and the likelihood of the elements),  and data used for
   making pseudo-MPECs.
COMMENT_SHUTOFF=

   By default,  observational uncertainties in position,  time,  and magnitude
   are extracted from 'sigma.txt' (q.v.).  If you alter that file,  though,
   you can rename it and specify that filename on the following line.  Find_Orb
   will then use those sigmas instead.

   If you generate ephems from the 'MPC code' (ATL),  Find_Orb will check
   visibility of the target and of the sun as seen from the four ATLAS
   telescopes,  (M22),  (T05),  (T08),  (W68),  and will pick the one that
   is best placed.  This is useful with telescope networks where you might
   well shift the imaging to whichever scope is best placed at a given time.
   Note that these 'MPC codes' also have lines in rovers.txt (q.v.).

   By default,  astrometric outliers by three sigmas will be rejected.  That's
   set by the following variable.  Set it to 9999999 to cause all observations
   to be included no matter how bad they are.  (Not something I recommend,  but
   you can do it.)
OUTLIER_REJECTION_LIMIT=3

   By default,  MOIDs will be shown for eight planets,  if they are low enough
   to be "interesting".  Set N_MOIDS=14,  and six asteroid MOIDs will also be
   shown (again,  only if they're low enough).  Don't set it to a higher value.
   At least at present,  those added six are all we've got.
N_MOIDS=8

   As a Find_Orb extension,  observations that are not to be distributed are
   marked with a '!' character in column 73.  If PRIVATE_OBS is left unset and
   you load up such observations,  Find_Orb will inquire as to whether those
   observations should be used.  PRIVATE_OBS=0 will skip the question and
   cause those observations to be included.  PRIVATE_OBS=1 will skip the
   question and cause those observations to be ignored.

    By default,  motion units in ephemerides are in arcminutes per hour (or,
    equivalently,  arcseconds per minute).  One can set the units with the
    following parameter.  The first character must be ", ', or d.  The
    second must be /.  The third must be s(econds), m(inutes), h(ours), or
    d(ays).  Requests for other units (milliradians,  etc.) will be
    entertained.
MOTION_UNITS="/min

   By default,  'temporary' files such as ephemerides,  astrometry reformatted
   to ADES,  debugging files,  orbital elements and ephemerides in text and JSON
   formats and more are written to the configuration directory ~/.find_orb (Linux)
   or to the current directory (Windows).  You can specify a directory explicitly
   with the following parameter,  and 'temporary' files will be put there instead.
OUTPUT_DIR=

   (Humans should never have to edit the following line.)  If Find_Orb
   encounters an unknown (and possibly newly assigned) observatory code,
   it will automatically download the latest copy of MPC's ObsCodes.html.  To
   avoid hammering MPC's servers, it will check the following values,  giving
   the JD of the last time it downloaded the file and a 'delay' time (by
   default,  0.1 day = 2.4 hours).  If the previous download was within that
   delay,  it doesn't make another request.
